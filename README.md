# Spatio-temporal dynamics of blood parasite infections and impacts on avian health and reproduction, by Buysse, Ollagnier et al.
This repository contains all datasets and command lines used in the production of the results presented in the article "Spatio-temporal dynamics of blood parasite infections and impacts on avian health and reproduction" by Buysse et al.  

The command lines concern five major analyses:
- Parasite detection and quantification
- Spatio-temporal patterns of infection
- Impacts on individual physiology
- Impact of infection on reproductive success (chick growth and survival)
- Impact of infection on movement
