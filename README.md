# Spatio-temporal dynamics of blood parasite infections and impacts on seabird health and reproduction, by Buysse, Ollagnier et al.
This repository contains all datasets and command lines used in the production of the results presented in the article "Spatio-temporal dynamics of blood parasite infections and impacts on avian health" by Buysse, Ollagnier et al.  

The repository is divided into five directories according to main results' types:
- Parasite detection and quantification
- Spatio-temporal patterns of infection
- Impacts on individual physiology
- Impact of infection on reproductive success (chick growth and survival)
- Impact of infection on movement
