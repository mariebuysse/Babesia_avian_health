This repository contains all datasets and command lines used in the production of the results presented in the article "Spatio-temporal dynamics of blood parasite infections and impacts on avian health and reproduction" by Buysse et al.  

The command lines concern five major analyses:
- Parasite detection and quantification
- Spatio-temporal patterns of infection
- Impacts on individual physiology
- Impact of infection on reproductive success (chick growth and survival)
- Impact of infection on movement

We included a supplementary script describing the calculation of Scaled Mass Index (SMI), further used in our analyses.
